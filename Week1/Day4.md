# Day 4: Creating Virtual Machines on AWS & Azure 

We dive deeper into Virtual Machines (VMs) and explore how to create them across cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and even on-premise setups.

### Efficiency in DevOps:

Manual VM creation vs automated provisioning

Importance of reducing repetitive tasks

Automation Approaches:

AWS CLI: Command-line interface to create/manage resources

AWS SDKs (e.g., Boto3 for Python): Programmatic access to AWS APIs

AWS CloudFormation Templates (CFT): Declarative infrastructure as code

Terraform: Platform-agnostic infrastructure automation tool


### Security & Access:

Key pair generation and importance

Understanding VM login authentication


### Best Practices:

Use Ubuntu for DevOps learning (recommended)

Always choose Free Tier eligible instances for practice

Save your key pairs securely for remote access


### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Platforms Covered:

Amazon EC2

Microsoft Azure VMs

AWS CLI, API, Boto3, CloudFormation

Terraform (multi-cloud support)


### üí° Pro Tips:
Choose the right automation tool based on your organization‚Äôs cloud strategy.

Avoid doing things manually when they can be automated.

Understand authentication, authorization, and request validation before calling APIs.
