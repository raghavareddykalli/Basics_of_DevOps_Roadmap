# Day-5 | Linux & Shell Scripting Basics

## Overview

In this session, we will focus on the introduction to the Linux operating system and basics of shell scripting as part of a complete DevOps course. 

### What an operating system (OS) is and its role as a bridge between hardware and software.

    - The communication flow between user, software, OS, and hardware (CPU, RAM, etc.)

    - User installs software → Software communicates with OS → OS communicates with hardware.

### Reasons for Linux's popularity:

    - Linux is free, secure, fast, and open-source.

    - It comes with distributions like CentOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat, making it suitable for production systems.

### Introduction to the **Linux kernel**:

    - The kernel is responsible for:

        - Device management

        - Memory management

        - Process management

        - System calls.

### Introduction to **Shell Scripting**:

    - Shell is used to interact with the operating system, especially on servers without a graphical user interface (GUI).

    #### Basic shell commands covered:

      - ```pwd```: Shows the current directory.

      - ```cd```: Changes directories.

      - ```ls```: Lists files and folders in the directory.

      - ```mkdir```: Creates directories.

      - ```rm```: Removes files or directories.

    #### Creating and managing files in the shell:

      - ```touch```: Creates a file.

      - ```vi```: Used to write content inside a file.
   
### Monitoring system performance:

    - ```top```: Monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage in real-time.

    - ```free```: Displays memory usage.

    - ```nproc```: Shows the number of CPUs.

    - ```df```: Displays disk space usage.

### Conclusion:

    - This is just a introduction to Shell Scripting we will deep dive further into Shell Scripting in coming days.
