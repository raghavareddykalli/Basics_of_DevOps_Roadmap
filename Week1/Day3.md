# Day 3: Virtual Machines 

Today, we‚Äôll cover one of the foundational concepts in DevOps ‚Äî Virtual Machines (VMs). 

### üìå What You'll Learn
What a server is and why it's important in DevOps.

Difference between physical servers and virtual machines.

Real-world analogy to understand virtualization.

How VMs improve resource efficiency.

The role of hypervisors in virtualization.

How cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud implement VMs.

Basic understanding of latency and data center regions.

### üß† Understanding Virtual Machines
Imagine owning a 1-acre piece of land. Initially, you build a house and use the whole acre, but over time you realize you're only using half of it. To use the remaining space efficiently, you build another home and rent it out.

This is similar to how physical servers work. A server might have 100 GB RAM and 100 CPUs, but your application only uses 4 GB RAM and 4 CPUs. The rest of the resources go unused.

With virtualization, you can divide that one physical server into multiple virtual servers (or virtual machines), each with isolated resources ‚Äî improving efficiency and resource utilization.

### üõ†Ô∏è What is a Hypervisor?
A hypervisor is software that enables you to create and manage virtual machines on a physical server. It logically separates the resources and allows multiple VMs to run independently.
Popular hypervisors:
VMware
Xen
Oracle VirtualBox
Each VM has its own:
CPU
RAM
Storage
Operating System
All this is done logically, not physically.

### üåê Virtual Machines in the Cloud
Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud use the same principle of virtualization at scale:
They build massive data centers in different regions (e.g., Mumbai, Ohio).
These data centers host thousands of physical servers.
When you request a VM (e.g., AWS EC2), a hypervisor allocates part of a physical server to create your virtual machine.
You don‚Äôt see the physical server ‚Äî you only interact with your VM, which behaves like a real machine.
This approach ensures:
 Efficient resource utilization
Low latency (selecting the closest region)
Cost-effectiveness for both users and providers

### ‚úÖ Summary
Virtual Machines (VMs) are logical partitions of physical servers.
VMs allow multiple applications or users to share hardware without interference.
DevOps practices aim to improve efficiency, and using VMs is a key method.
Hypervisors make VM creation possible and are essential to cloud infrastructure.
Cloud platforms rely on VMs to scale globally and serve users reliably.
