- DevOps is **a culture and practice** that enhances an organization’s ability to **deliver applications efficiently**.  
- Different companies define DevOps in their own way, but at its core, it focuses on:  
  - **Faster software delivery**  
  - **Automation**  
  - **Continuous improvement**  

### 4. Why DevOps?  
- **Traditional software delivery challenges**:  
  - Manual deployment processes were slow and inefficient.  
  - System administrators and build engineers worked separately, leading to delays.  
- **DevOps addresses these challenges** by introducing:  
  - **Automation** for faster deployment.  
  - **Collaboration** between development and operations teams.  
  - **CI/CD pipelines** to ensure continuous integration and delivery.  

### 5. Key Pillars of DevOps  
1. **Automation** – Reducing manual effort in deployment and infrastructure management.  
2. **Quality Assurance** – Ensuring high software quality with continuous testing.  
3. **Monitoring** – Keeping track of system health and performance.  
4. **Testing** – Continuous testing to detect and prevent failures early.  

### 6. Real-World Examples  
- **Android security updates** must be deployed **quickly** to prevent security vulnerabilities.  
- **Online platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.)** need **fast and frequent deployments** to remain competitive.  
- **Gaming industry (PUBG updates)** relies on **seamless feature rollouts** without downtime.  

### 7. DevOps Career Tips  
- **How to introduce yourself in a DevOps interview**:  
  - Mention your **DevOps experience** and previous roles (e.g., System Admin, Build Engineer).  
  - Highlight **DevOps tools & technologies** you’ve worked with.  
  - Be **honest** about your experience level—DevOps has been widely adopted only in the last **7-8 years**.
