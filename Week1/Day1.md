- **DevOps addresses these challenges** by introducing:  
  - **Automation** for faster deployment.  
  - **Collaboration** between development and operations teams.  
  - **CI/CD pipelines** to ensure continuous integration and delivery.  

### ðŸ“Œ Key Pillars of DevOps  
1. **Automation** â€“ Reducing manual effort in deployment and infrastructure management.  
2. **Quality Assurance** â€“ Ensuring high software quality with continuous testing.  
3. **Monitoring** â€“ Keeping track of system health and performance.  
4. **Testing** â€“ Continuous testing to detect and prevent failures early.  

### ðŸ“Œ Real-World Examples  
- **Android security updates** must be deployed **quickly** to prevent security vulnerabilities.  
- **Online platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.)** need **fast and frequent deployments** to remain competitive.  
- **Gaming industry (PUBG updates)** relies on **seamless feature rollouts** without downtime.  

### ðŸ“Œ DevOps Career Tips  
- **How to introduce yourself in a DevOps interview**:  
  - Mention your **DevOps experience** and previous roles (e.g., System Admin, Build Engineer).
