# ðŸ“Œ Day 4: Top 15 AWS Services Every DevOps Engineer Should Learn

In this session, we covers the top 15 AWS services that are crucial for any DevOps engineer to master. AWS offers over 200 services, but this curated list focuses on the essentials for DevOps workflows, automation, and efficiency.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

DevOps is centered around automation and efficiency.

AWS follows the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).

Not all 200+ AWS services are necessary to learn â€” focus on DevOps-relevant ones.

## âœ… Top 15 AWS Services for DevOps Engineers

#### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
