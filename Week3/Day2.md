# 📅 Day 2: Introduction to CI/CD

##📌 Overview:

In this session, we will discuss about the concept of CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery), its importance in modern software development, and how it works in both legacy and modern setups.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered:

### ✅ What is CI/CD?

**CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automating the integration of code changes into a shared repository.

**CD (Continuous Delivery)**: Automating the delivery/deployment of applications to production or other environments.

### ⚙️ Why CI/CD?

-Speeds up the delivery process from code commit to customer deployment.

-Ensures automated testing, code quality checks, security scanning, and seamless deployment.

-Essential for global teams and modern scalable applications.

### 🔁 Typical CI/CD Workflow:

-Code is committed to a Version Control System (e.g., GitHub).

-CI/CD Pipeline triggers upon commit or pull request.

#### Automated steps executed:

-Unit Testing

-Static Code Analysis

-Code Quality & Vulnerability Testing

-Functional (End-to-End) Testing

-Reporting

-Deployment to environments (Dev → Staging → Production)

### 🧪 Breakdown of Key Steps:

**Unit Testing**: Verifies individual components of the application.

**Static Code Analysis**: Detects issues like unused variables or inefficient code.

**Vulnerability Testing**: Ensures no security holes are introduced.

**End-to-End Testing**: Validates the application as a whole, not just recent changes.

**Reporting**: Provides insight into test results and overall build health.

**Deployment**: Final step to make the application available to customers.

## 🛠 Tools Discussed:

### 🔧 Legacy Tools:

**Jenkins**: Popular orchestration tool.

-Integrates with tools like Maven, JUnit, SonarQube.

-Supports multi-stage deployment (Dev, Staging, Prod).

-Can be resource-heavy in large setups.

### 🚀 Modern Tools:

**GitHub Actions**:

-Serverless and event-driven CI/CD.

-Auto-scales using containers or Kubernetes pods.

-More efficient for large-scale or open-source projects.

-Alternatives:

**GitLab CI/CD**

**CircleCI**

## 🧩 Real-World Examples:

-Kubernetes uses GitHub Actions to manage CI/CD across 3000+ contributors efficiently.

-Organizations with microservices architectures benefit from scalable CI/CD setups that reduce idle resource usage.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:

-Jenkins is a great orchestrator but can become complex and expensive at scale.

-GitHub Actions provides a modern, cost-effective alternative.

-CI/CD should be tailored to your application's requirements.

-Automation is key to rapid, secure, and reliable software delivery.

## 🔮 Coming Up:

-Hands-on projects using Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

-Practical walkthroughs of CI/CD setup and pipeline creation.
